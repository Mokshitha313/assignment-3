//assumptions for the above assignment

Q1:
In this question, I created a personal website using HTML and CSS and hosted it on GitHub Pages. The site includes sections for my introduction, education, skills, achievements, and a link to my CV. I also added a profile picture and a gallery of local images from my birthplace.

Assumptions:
1)The profile and local images are stored in a folder named assets/images.
2)The CV is added as cv.pdf and linked using an anchor tag.
3)Styling is done using an external CSS file named styles.css.


Q2:
For this task, I implemented a JavaScript function that tracks and logs user interactions across the entire webpage. It captures both click and view (load) events, and prints details like the timestamp, event type, and element involved (e.g., image, paragraph, dropdown) to the browser console.

Assumptions:
1)All interactions are logged using console.log() with the format: Timestamp, Event Type, Target Element.
2)I considered mouseover as a “view” event for non-click interactions.
3)Events are attached using addEventListener to all relevant DOM elements.


Q3:
In this question, I added a large text area for input (over 10,000 words) and wrote JavaScript to analyze the text. It calculates and displays counts of letters, words, spaces, newlines, and special symbols. It also tokenizes the input and counts pronouns, prepositions, and articles grouped accordingly.

Assumptions:
1)Predefined sets of pronouns, prepositions, and indefinite articles are used.
2)Input is analyzed in real time using an event listener (input or change).
3)The output is displayed dynamically below the text box in a formatted layout.


Execution Instructions:
1)Open index.html in a browser OR navigate to the GitHub Pages link.
2)Explore the site to trigger click and view events (check console).
3)Enter large text in the Text Analysis section and click "Analyze Text" to view results.
4)To download or view the CV, click the "Download My CV (PDF)" link.

Assumptions:
1)All necessary resources (images, CV) are present in the same directory or subfolders as per structure.
2)script.js handles both Q2 and Q3 functionality.
3)Images and CV are assumed to exist locally and be named exactly as referenced (profile.jpg, birthplace.jpg, CV.pdf).
